# Stacks and Queues

## Challenge
Write a class for stacks that has three methods: push, pop, and peek.
Write a class for queue that has three methods: enqueue, dequeue, and peek.

## Approach & Efficiency
The Big O for all of my methods was O(1). I didn't ever loop through the list but rather simply added or removed the node.

## API
Stacks:
* push: push takes a value and adds it the top of the stack
* pop: removes the top value from the stack and returns it
* peek: reutrns the top value of the stack without removing it

Queues:
* enqueue: take a value and adds a node to the rear of the Queue
* dequeue: removes the front value of the Queue.
* peek: reutrns the top value of the stack without removing it
